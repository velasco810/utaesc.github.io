My name is Luis Salas Nunez, I'm pursuing a double major in aerospace and mechanical engineering, and I'm the vice president of the engineering student council for the 2015-2016 term. I became involved in the ESC after the NAESC regional conference held at Missouri, in 2014. It was one of the most enriching experiences I have experienced during my college life. It made me realize how a good Student Council can be extremely beneficial for the student body. At the same time I realized the long road that we at UTA have ahead. However, I believe that we have a great human talent, and that working together we can gain more recognition and improve the college experience for the students. I invite the student body to approach us, we are here to serve you.
