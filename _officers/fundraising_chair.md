Me llamo Cesar Aguilera. I was appointed Fundraising Chair for the Engineering Student Council in the spring of 2015. I am a sophomore at UTA pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. As the Fundraising Chair I would like to raise money through various events which would benefit the Engineering Student Council tremendously. I hope by joining the ESC I can do my part in making it an even better organization.
