My name is Fawaad Hyder Khan. I have been an International peer advisor, a tutor, and a Chief Event coordinator in my Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am now pursuing my Masters in EE at UTA. Recently, I have been involved a lot on campus in organizations such as GSS, UTA volunteers, MUN, MAVS for UNICEF, S.H.A.C. and joined the ESC board as the Internal Communications Chair. I intend to make ESC stronger than ever by bringing all the fellow technical organizations and students under one strong umbrella.
