My name is Michael Theriot. I first began programming in middle school and now I'm a software engineering major at UTA. I've been involved in the CSE department as a teaching assistant for two semesters and I'm now the webmaster officer for the ESC. My goals during my term are to set up a website and make it an easier platform for students to get involved.
