Hi everyone! My name is Pauline Nguyen, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I will be this year's ESC Public Relations Chair, and I'm also the Maverick Billiards club's Vice President! As your PR Chair, I think it's important to be able to communicate to others the essence of engineering in a way that makes it both empowering and interesting to people that may be unfamiliar with what engineering is. In a world where technology continues to improve and affect the lives of people, the way we present UTA's engineering program through media is equally important.

In layman's terms, what I do is create ESC flyers, posters, trifolds, shirt designs, and advertisements. I'll also be updating ESC social media such as the Facebook page, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Furthermore, I'm often found with my DSLR, so if you're at one of our events, smile for the camera!
