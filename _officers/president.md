My name is Abira Syed and I am the current president of the Engineering Student Council. I am an incoming Junior in Manufacturing Systems and Industrial Engineering.

First and foremost, it is an honor and utmost privilege to serve you as your president. As president, my main goals for the upcoming school year are to unite the National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC) with the UTAESC Chapter, unite the different engineering organizations and enhance the engineering educational experience by creating educational workshops as well as having activities/events for the engineering students. It is crucial to create leading and well-rounded engineers in this booming economy and it is my duty to serve the College of Engineering.
