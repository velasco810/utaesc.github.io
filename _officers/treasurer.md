My name is Enrique Mustieles; I am an international senior student majoring in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering. The reason why I am so passionate about my degree, specifically about the business aspect of it, is the same reason why I believed I would be the perfect fit for the Treasurer position of the Engineering Student Council at The University of Texas at Arlington. I've learned that money is one of the most relevant elements an organization can have and every organization needs a good leader to create and manage a good budget. Thus, one of the things I hope to accomplish during my office term is to bring income to the organization from different sources. To mention a few ideas on how to do this would be to work with the Fundraising Chair of the organization to plan and execute fundraisers as well as build and maintain relationships with different sponsors.
