Hello everyone! My name is Omar Ramirez and I am the current secretary for the Engineering Student Council and a Mechanical Engineering major. Before joining ESC I attended many of their conferences and General Body Meetings to get an idea of the opportunities ESC offers. Through my experience I found that ESC allowed me to put into practice the skills necessary to be successful in an internship or in a job within my field of study. As a result, I felt obligated to give back to the organization by becoming their secretary. As secretary it's my job to aid Abira Syed, the current president, by keeping every officer inform on the task each one of them needs to perform. I look forward to an outstanding year and helping ESC expand like it deserves to.
