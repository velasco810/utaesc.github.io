Hello Everyone! My name is Archana Mohan. I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington. I will be serving as the External Communication Chair for the upcoming year.

As an External Communication Chair, my responsibility includes contacting companies & alumni and arranging for sponsorships, which will help our organization's monetary needs. As a part of betterment of our knowledge of the industry, I would like to arrange for some speakers who will address our audience regarding the current market trends and give us firsthand account of what is expected of our graduates. I will also be communicating with various companies (specifically related to the College of Engineering) and getting them to attend our Career Fairs. More companies equal more opportunities for our students!!
