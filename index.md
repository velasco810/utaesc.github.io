# Engineering Student Council

Engineering Student Council (ESC) is an organization that represents all of the Engineering Student Organizations at the University of Texas at Arlington. We hold events such as Career Fairs, Space Week, E-Week as well as speaker events, fundraisers and other events to benefit and enhance the engineering educational experience for the College of Engineering students.

The mission of the Engineering Student Council is:

* To unite engineering students and their organizations on campus
* To serve as the students’ representative within the College of Engineering
* To provide resources to students for their initiatives that effect positive change
* To offer committee and leadership experience to its members

## National Association of Engineering Student Councils

The National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC) is a nationwide organization composed of more than 50 schools from all over the country that strives to improve the engineering educational experience by creating a network of communication among the different ESC organizations nationwide. The organization plays a vital role in nurturing and developing leaders in engineering, who later on go on to play major roles in their fields upon graduation. NAESC regional and national conferences attract industry-leading companies from all engineering fields, resulting in great networking opportunities with prospective employers. These conferences are a great way to meet new people and make friends across the country.
